1) Information Gathering : This is the step where we start knowing the target. I generally start with whois, nslookup, dns enumeration. Try to idenfity subdomains.
Fingerprinting is also important by using dig, nmap, whatweb, netcat, whatweb, wappalyzer and more. Credential stuffing and password spraying need to be done as well. This
phase can be broken into two steps : active info gathering and passive info gathering.
