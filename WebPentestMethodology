1) Information Gathering : This is the step where we start knowing the target. I generally start with whois, nslookup, dns enumeration. Try to idenfity subdomains.
Fingerprinting is also important by using dig, nmap, whatweb, netcat, whatweb, wappalyzer, netcraft site report and more. Credential stuffing and 
password spraying need to be done as well. This phase can be broken into two steps : active info gathering and passive info gathering.

Credential stuffing -> weleakinfo, haveibeenpwned, hunter.io

2) Scanning and Enumeration : Configure Burp Suite with Foxy Proxy.
Burp Suite -> Target -> Scope -> Use advanced scope control -> Host -> .*\.domainname\.com$
